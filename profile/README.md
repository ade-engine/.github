## 🧠 Mission

Debugging is one of the most expensive and time-consuming parts of software development.

Our mission is simple:

> Software should be able to debug itself.

ade-engine builds autonomous systems that identify, analyze, and fix software issues.

## 🏗 Infrastructure-Level Approach

ADE is not a chatbot.

It is not autocomplete.

It is not code generation.

ADE operates as infrastructure.
